# food-lookup-api

This is a basic Rails API borrowed from this tutorial: https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/

So far there is an api endpoint to fetch nutrition data and responds with json

I have added rack-cors to make it accessable outside of it's own domain
